# Book List

## Introduction

The task was to write simple book list using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which will contain a form that accepts the following fields:

-   Book title (at least 1 character)
-   Book author (at least 3 characters)
-   Reading priority (numbers from 1 do 5)
-   List with categories (3 categories to choose from)
-   Button enabling sending

After sending the form, the page cannot be reloaded. Simultaneously display the added book in the table, and clear the form.
Acceptance criteria:

-   Validation for form fields. In case a field is not validated, the book cannot be added.
-   The user can add another book to the table.
-   The whole table is saved in localstorage (when the browser is reopened, it is reloaded and displayed with the same state as it was when it was closed).
